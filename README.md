# Scala wrapper for the Withing (Nokia Health) API

This wrapper allows you to use the [Health API](developer.health.nokia.com/api/doc); it supports OAuth authentication, setting up notifications and querying measurements.

It makes use of the [ScribeJava](https://github.com/scribejava/scribejava) OAuth client library and [Play JSON](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/ScalaJson) for converting API results to Scala case classes.
